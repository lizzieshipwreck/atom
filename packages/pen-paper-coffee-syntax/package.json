  "readme": "# Pen Paper Coffee :pencil2::scroll::coffee:\n*Pen Paper Coffee* is a syntax theme for the text editor [atom](http://atom.io/), which is designed specifically for writing papers, essays etc. in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).\nThe theme features ~~increased font-sizes for each level of headers~~ (see *changes* on the bottom), several useful, but not distracting syntax highlightings.\nThe overall colors are inspired by the soft beige paper you would find in a notebook. While the ink (text color) is a dark blue, all quotes and citations are in a warm brownish orange to contrast them better to your own words. When writing text, not code, I usually set a line height of 1.4 or 1.5 in atoms settings, as you can see in the sample screenshots.\n\nAlthough this theme was designed for markdown usage, I paid attention that it still looks good and clear with other documents (eg. html, javascript, C).\n\nThe screenshots without gutter and text centering had [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen) installed, if you like to have centered text but still see the gutter, treeview and tabs [typewriter](https://atom.io/packages/typewriter) might be for you.\n\nWhen you want to cite stuff from eg. a bibtex file, I find a great package to use together with this theme is [autocomplete bibtex](https://github.com/apcshields/autocomplete-bibtex). It's a great help when combining it with [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) for pdf & latex export from markdown. Work great with the [language-pfm](https://github.com/leipert/language-pfm) package.\n\n### screenshots\n\n![markdown with zen mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_1.png)\n\nsupport for critic markup:\n![critic markup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/criticmarkup.png)\n\n![css screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_4.png)\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_2.png)\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_3.png)\n\n## changes\n### 2. October 2015\n\nDue to rendering issues in Atom, I reduced the increased fonts for headings. It made too many problems unfortunately :/\nIf the issues are resolved I would love to get the increased heading sizes back! (you still can get the *old* version at: https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax/releases/tag/v0.9.1 if you don't mind the strange cursor positionings and the problems listed in the issue below)\nRelevant issues:\n\n- [https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax/issues/20#issuecomment-144845830](https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax/issues/20#issuecomment-144845830)\n\n- [https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6055](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6055)\n\n### 11. April 2015\nI changed the gutter to a lighter brown, which is much more pleasing, atleast to my eyes. If you prefer the darker gutter, just comment out and uncomment the following lines in `colors.less` to your liking:\n```.less\n// gutter colors\n@heftstreifen: rgb(224, 218, 211);\n\n//@heftstreifen: rgb(202, 193, 186); //old darker gutter\n```\n",
